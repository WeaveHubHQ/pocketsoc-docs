# Team Management

The **Team** page lets admins invite new members, manage roles, and remove users from the organization.

## Viewing your team

The Team page shows all current members and any pending invitations. Each member entry displays:

- Name and email
- Role (Admin or Member)
- Date joined

## Inviting a new member

1. Go to **Team** and click **Invite Member**.
2. Enter the person's email address.
3. Select a role:
   - **Admin** — Full portal access including team management, billing, and vendor configs
   - **Member** — Can use the iOS app and view the portal but cannot modify settings
4. Click **Send Invitation**.

The invitee receives an email with a link to accept the invitation. When they click the link, they are directed to create an account (or sign in if they already have one) and are automatically added to your organization.
