# Billing

PocketSOC billing is managed through Stripe. You can upgrade, downgrade, and manage payment methods from the portal Settings page.

## Upgrading your plan

1. Go to **Settings** in the portal.
2. Scroll to the **Plan** section.
3. Select **Monthly** or **Annual** billing (annual saves 2 months).
4. Click **Upgrade to Pro** or **Upgrade to Enterprise**.
5. Complete the Stripe Checkout flow.

Your plan activates immediately after payment.

## Monthly vs annual billing

| Plan | Monthly | Annual | Annual savings |
|------|---------|--------|----------------|
| Pro | $29/month | $290/year | $58/year (2 months free) |
| Enterprise | $599/month | $5,990/year | $1,198/year (2 months free) |

## Managing your subscription

Click **Manage Billing** in Settings to open the Stripe customer portal. From there you can:

- View and download invoices
- Update your payment method
- Cancel your subscription
- Switch between monthly and annual billing

## Invoice billing

Enterprise customers can request invoice billing (NET 30) instead of credit card payments. Contact support to arrange this.

## What happens when you downgrade

If you downgrade to a plan with a lower device limit:

- Your existing devices remain active
- You cannot register new devices until you are under the new limit
- To register new devices, deactivate unused ones from the Devices page

## Cancellation

When you cancel, your plan remains active until the end of the current billing period. After that, your organization reverts to the Free plan (2 devices).
