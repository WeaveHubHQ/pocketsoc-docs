# Organization Settings

Organization settings are found on the **Settings** page in the portal. Only admins can modify these settings.

## Organization name

Your organization name is displayed in the portal header and on team member invitations. To change it:

1. Go to **Settings**.
2. Edit the **Organization Name** field.
3. Click **Save**.

## Billing email

The billing email is used for Stripe receipts and invoices. It defaults to the admin's email but can be changed to a shared mailbox (e.g., `billing@yourcompany.com`).

## Organization ID

Your organization ID is a unique identifier assigned when your organization is created. It cannot be changed. You may need this when contacting support.
