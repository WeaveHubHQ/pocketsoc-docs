Your plan takes effect immediately and your device limit is updated.

## Managing your subscription

After upgrading, you can manage your subscription from the portal:

- Click **Manage Billing** in Settings to open the Stripe customer portal
- From there you can update your payment method, view invoices, or cancel

## Enterprise invoicing

Enterprise customers can request invoice billing instead of credit card payments. Contact support to set this up.

## Downgrading

To downgrade, open the Stripe billing portal from **Settings > Manage Billing**. If you downgrade to a plan with fewer device slots than you currently have active, you will need to deactivate devices until you are within the new limit.
